>**Defusing Cobol bombs**  
>COBOL bombs are not a problem because they are written in COBOL; they are a problem because the number of engineers who understand what they are doing well enough to maintain them is shrinking. Transpiling poorly documented, poorly organized COBOL into **Language** (i.e.:Java) just creates poorly documented, poorly organized, atypical Java code. The output of the transpiler is generally loaded with constructs and work arounds that are not intuitive to a good Java developer and may create hidden performance issues._ *M.Bellotti*

>**The real problem**  
The real problem is, and always has been, the fact that the failed systems hadn’t been maintained properly. COBOL code failing in the modern world is a symptom of **insufficient maintenance**, not a **cause of failure**.
Once you know how to program, learning programming languages is easy. Understanding existing programs is hard. Maintaining existing programs (in the form of what we call refactoring) is the most difficult part, by far. Actually providing the programmers the time and money to make sure the fixes stick when things need to change again? ***That’s the real cost, right there.***
