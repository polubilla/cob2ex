## General Considerations  
<!-- Introducción a las consideraciones generales. -->

"_COBOL bombs are not a problem because they are written in COBOL; they are a problem because the number of engineers who understand what they are doing well enough to maintain them is shrinking. Transpiling poorly documented, poorly organized COBOL into **Language** (i.e.:Java) just creates poorly documented, poorly organized, atypical Java code. The output of the transpiler is generally loaded with constructs and work arounds that are not intuitive to a good Java developer and may create hidden performance issues._" *M.Bellotti*
